# Pinterest Image Analytics Pipeline
An end-to-end image analytics system that combines web scraping, computer vision, and cloud computing to analyze Pinterest food images and user engagement patterns.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data pipeline that scrapes Pinterest food images, applies AWS computer vision analysis, and derives insights about user engagement behaviors. The system integrates multiple data sources and cloud services to perform both technical image analysis and statistical correlation studies.

## Key Features

* Dual Data Collection: Python Selenium automation + Apify no-code platform
* Computer Vision Analysis: AWS Rekognition for object detection and image quality assessment
* Engagement Analytics: Statistical analysis of user interaction patterns
* Cloud Integration: AWS SageMaker notebooks with Firebase database storage
* Data Visualization: Correlation analysis and behavioral pattern identification

## Technical Stack
* Programming: Python (Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests)
* Cloud Services: AWS SageMaker, AWS Rekognition, Firebase
* Data Analysis: Statistical analysis, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Web Scraping: Selenium WebDriver, Apify platform
* Database: Firebase NoSQL cloud database

## Project Results

* 75 Pinterest food images collected and analyzed
* 95% correlation between shares and repins identified
* Object detection with confidence scoring implemented
* Image quality metrics (brightness/sharpness) assessed
* Multi-dataset integration with cloud storage
